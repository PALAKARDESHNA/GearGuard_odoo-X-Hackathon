## 💬 Talking Points

### When Showing Equipment:
"Managers can track every piece of equipment with complete details. Notice how we can assign teams, set default technicians, and even track work centers for cost analysis."

### When Showing Requests:
"The smart auto-fill feature means less typing and fewer errors. Select equipment, and the system knows which team should handle it."

### When Showing Kanban:
"This drag-and-drop interface makes status updates instant. Technicians can see their work at a glance, and managers can spot bottlenecks immediately."

### When Showing Reports:
"Data-driven decisions start here. See which equipment fails most often, which teams are busiest, and where costs are highest."

### When Showing Roles:
"Security is built-in. Employees can report issues but can't modify requests. Technicians can work on requests but can't manage equipment. Only managers have full access."
